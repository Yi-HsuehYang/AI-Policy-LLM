    "output": "Some of the advantages are as follows:
                - Enables sectoral agencies to audit and regulate ADSs within their authority
                - Addresses gaps in regulation, clarifies legal uncertainties and empowers agencies to oversee ADSs impacting critical socioeconomic determinations
                - Allows US to be recognized as an undisputed leader in trustworthy AI, leading to global business development opportunities
                - Regulatory flexibility, enables better international alignment and strengthens trade relationships"},
    {"input": "What are some limitations or disadvantages of the CASC approach?", 
    "output": "Some of the limitations/disadvantages of the CASC approach are as follows:
                - Limited by the pace of the process, and its dependence of rule making makes the process an inherently  retroactive rather than proactive approach
                - A lengthy regulatory process undermines efficacy of the approach
                - Additional expertise and staff capacity required within covered agencies for effective regulation execution"}
