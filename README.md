# Building and Evaluating PolicyChat

## Project Overview
- Objective: In this project, we develop a fine-tuned Large Language Model that is capable of understanding and answering questions related to AI policy and will be called “AI Policy Chat”. The project will leverage the power of LLMs to process and generate human-like text, providing insightful and contextually relevant responses to policy-related queries. The AI Policy Chat will evaluate three alternative architectures. First, will be to perform prompt engineering on a base Llama-2 7b model; followed by building a retrieval augmented generation architecture; and finally fine-tuning the base Llama-2 7b model. The project will be divided into two phases: data collection and model development, and model fine-tuning and performance evaluation.

## Part 1: Data Collection and Dataset Creation

## Part 2: Model Development and Analysis
We will experiment with three ways of using pre-trained large language models.
