# Building and Evaluating AI Policy Chat

## Project Overview
**Objective:** In this project, we develop a fine-tuned Large Language Model that is capable of understanding and answering questions related to AI policy and will be called “AI Policy Chat”. The project will leverage the power of LLMs to process and generate human-like text, providing insightful and contextually relevant responses to policy-related queries. The AI Policy Chat will evaluate three alternative architectures. First, will be to perform prompt engineering on a base Llama-2 7b model; followed by building a retrieval augmented generation architecture; and finally fine-tuning the base Llama-2 7b model. The project is strategically segmented into two main phases: the initial phase focuses on data collection and the creation of a comprehensive dataset, followed by a second phase dedicated to model development, fine-tuning, and meticulous performance evaluation. The ultimate aim is to produce "AI Policy Chat," an AI-driven platform that harnesses the transformative power of LLMs to generate insightful, accurate, and contextually relevant answers to a broad spectrum of policy-related queries.

## Part 1: Data Collection and Dataset Creation

A pivotal component of this project is the assembly of a robust dataset from a collection of raw documents, meticulously sourced to cover a broad array of AI policy issues. These documents form the foundational corpus for training and fine-tuning the LLM, ensuring that "AI Policy Chat" is well-equipped to handle queries with nuanced understanding and precision. The dataset and related materials are accessible here, offering a glimpse into the depth and breadth of information that informs this project.

## Part 2: Model Development and Analysis Methodologies
The project's methodology is characterized by innovation and rigor, encompassing three distinct strategies for leveraging pre-trained LLMs:

- Prompt Engineering on Base Llama-2 7b Model: This approach involves the creative design of prompts to guide the model in generating relevant responses, setting the stage for more sophisticated model interactions.
- Retrieval Augmented Generation Architecture: An exploration into augmenting the LLM's capabilities by integrating it with a retrieval system, enhancing the model's ability to access and incorporate external information into its responses.
- Fine-tuning the Base Llama-2 7b Model: The crux of the project, this strategy focuses on refining the model's understanding and output through targeted fine-tuning, using the curated dataset of AI policy documents.

## Objectives and Anticipated Outcomes:

The project is driven by a series of ambitious objectives, including:

- Developing an LLM that not only responds to AI policy queries but does so with an unprecedented level of comprehension and insight.
- Evaluating the efficacy of different architectural approaches in enhancing the model's performance and utility in the policy domain.
- Offering valuable contributions to the fields of AI policy research and AI-driven advisory systems.

Upon completion, "AI Policy Chat" is expected to serve as a groundbreaking tool for policymakers, researchers, and enthusiasts, facilitating informed discussions and decisions in the rapidly evolving arena of AI governance. This project, with its innovative use of LLMs, sets a new benchmark in the intersection of artificial intelligence and policy analysis, heralding a future where AI plays a pivotal role in shaping and understanding policy landscapes.
